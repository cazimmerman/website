I study how the <strong>brain</strong> senses the physiological state of the <strong>body</strong> and uses that information to control <strong>behavior</strong>. My goals are to discover and characterize new body-to-brain sensory signals and to identify neural coding mechanisms that link these interoceptive signals to motivation and learning.

<strong>Currently:</strong> I am a postdoctoral fellow in <a href='https://www.wittenlab.org/' target='_blank'>Ilana Witten’s lab</a> at the <a href='https://pni.princeton.edu/' target='_blank'>Princeton Neuroscience Institute</a>. My main project uses brainwide neural recordings and computational modeling to investigate how body-to-brain signals drive learning. In a separate project, I collaborate with members of the <a href='https://www.internationalbrainlab.com/' target='_blank'>International Brain Laboratory</a> to explore how dopamine modulates brainwide dynamics during reinforcement learning.

<strong>Previously:</strong> I was a graduate student in <a href='https://knightlab.ucsf.edu/' target='_blank'>Zachary Knight’s lab</a> in the <a href='https://physiology.ucsf.edu' target='_blank'>UCSF Department of Physiology</a> and <a href='https://neurograd.ucsf.edu' target='_blank'>UCSF Neuroscience Graduate Program</a>. My thesis research focused on the neural mechanisms that govern thirst and drinking behavior. We discovered that sensory signals originating throughout the body — including from the mouth, throat, and gut — come together within individual neurons in the brain to produce the sense of thirst and control drinking behavior on a moment-by-moment basis.
